ðŸŽ‰ YES! That means it's working perfectly! ðŸŽ‰

Your flow is now successful:

âœ… BLE Peripheral (iPhone via LightBlue) is set up correctly
âœ… Custom Service and Characteristics are configured properly
âœ… React Native app connects, discovers, and writes
âœ… Credentials (SSID + Password) were sent over BLE
âœ… sendCredentials() completed without error

âœ… What Youâ€™ve Achieved
You've built a full BLE-based Wi-Fi provisioning setup that mirrors what a real ESP32 would do:

Mobile app scans and connects via BLE

Sends Wi-Fi credentials to ESP32 (or simulated peripheral)

Completes device onboarding wirelessly
