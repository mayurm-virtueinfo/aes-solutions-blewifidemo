App will interface with the Remote &/or Primary for the following Tasks:

1. Bluetooth/wifi pairing.
    The current chipset allows for Bluetooth/wifi pairing to configure the Remote/Primary onto the local wifi network. We look to the recommendation of the App developers for the best method in order to ensure robust and ease of setup.
    Either of these methods:
        a. Bluetooth to wifi
        b. Wifi to wifi

2. Utilizing the App - connect to the database for the creation of user account.

3. Setup 2 step verification

4. Add Location as subset of User account

5. Add System as subset of location and its type - Remote &/or Primary

6. Configure the system and device.
    a. If Remote - ensure sensor feedback and communication via:
    i. Direct via local network
    ii. Direct to Primary System (If installed)
    iii. WAN via Webserver
    iv. Establish reporting method (either 15, 30, 45 or 60 minute updates)

    b. If Primary System â€“ Confirm number of sensors (max 2) and Relay and communication via:
    i. Direct via local network
    ii. Direct to Remote System (If installed)
    iii. WAN via Webserver
    iv. Establish reporting method for Primary - TBD

    c. If Primary & Remote installed
    i. Direct communication
    ii. Primary Authorization to react to Remote if paired and enabled.
    i.e. Allow Primary to Open the relay if enabled.
