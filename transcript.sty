0:04 - Jeff Owens
  Hello, Jonah's note-taker.

0:10 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  He's pretty quiet, Jeff. I don't know if you're going to hear from him. Thank you.

1:00 - Eric Silverthorn
  you. Thank

2:19 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Hey, how are you? I'm doing well. How are you doing?

2:23 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Doing all right. Wonderful. Trying to do it. My dog is not happy, but I'm okay.

2:29 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Why is he not happy?

2:32 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Probably because I'm not taking her out.

2:34 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  There you go. What kind of dog do you know? She's a German short-haired pointer. Oh, it's a pretty dog.

2:41 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  And she's 16 and very temperamental lately.

2:47 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Oh, wow. 16 is incredible.

2:50 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Yeah, she's letting me know. We have a German Shepherd-Pyrenees mix.

2:58 - Eric Silverthorn
  Oh, wow. That's a big dog. And he's, well... We adopted him at a shelter, and they said, oh, he's a shepherd mix.  We couldn't tell. He's Pyrenees. And they said, yeah, he'll be a 40-pound dog.

3:12 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Yeah, right. More like 140 if you're lucky.

3:16 - Eric Silverthorn
  Well, he has, from a size point, he's more shepherd-ish, but he's one years old. He's about 75 pounds now.

3:26 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Oh, you got lucky and got on the smaller end.

3:29 - Eric Silverthorn
  He's still a horse, though, and they're very attention-craving, the Pyrenees part, and so that's- All that is claw.

3:40 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Oh, yeah.

3:41 - Eric Silverthorn
  So he has dewclaws, and it turns out he actually has extra dewclaws. Got the doubles?

3:48 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Yeah.

3:49 - Eric Silverthorn
  So he's got, let's see. I don't know. I think dogs are supposed to have four toes, maybe four toes per foot or whatever.  My wife had the- looks He's that �örepresented See... Nails trim the other day, and so they gave her the bill.  It's $40-something that they were charging her for the extra claws. And my wife says, that's ridiculous. I can go get a manicure for, you know, for like half of that or whatever.  And anyway, the tech ended up coming back and saying, yeah, we won't charge you for the five extra claws that this dog has, this mutant dog has.  But, hey, Jonah, do you want me to start, or do you want to? Well, so James, want to make sure I don't want to leave Chris out.

4:36 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Oh, and neither does he. He just joined. Let me put him in.

4:40 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  He's probably usually, I'm usually more of a Linux person, so I have a Windows laptop, so getting Google to work was fun this morning.

4:50 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Hey, Chris.

4:53 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  He's on mute still, I think.

4:55 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  He is on mute.

4:58 - Jeff Owens
  Maybe you'll hear us say that. What flavor of Linux do you run?

5:04 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  It's an old beat-up one called Slackware. I mean, it's relatively new, but not many people use it. Everybody uses Ubuntu or Manjaro or some other flavor.  Well, they're all the same, essentially, except for the fact that it's manager, so, eh, and a few commands. But it's been a learning curve for me to try to figure out why Windows doesn't ever do what I want it to.  Because they don't want you to do everything you want to do.

5:35 - Eric Silverthorn
  Without paying them, right?

5:37 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Yeah. I think, usually, when, I know when Chris, sometimes his buds, his earbuds act up. There we go. I see.

5:47 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  There we go. Hey, Chris.

5:49 - Chris
  Yep, we can hear you. Microsoft and Google don't play well. There we go.

5:57 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Never have. Well, thanks for joining, Chris and Jim. James, I don't know if y'all have seen Eric yet. Chris, I know you and Eric have spoken on the phone a couple of times, but I'm glad that we were able to have a call today.  The devices are en route, and we should have those with our team next week, but I'm glad that we can have this time to answer any questions that we have and set expectations for you guys.  But, Eric, I know you wanted to kick it off.
///////-------start-here
6:23 - Eric Silverthorn
  Yeah, thanks, Jonah. Guys, I just want to be sure that I understand how this works. And so we're going to be connecting via Bluetooth to your primary device.  Your primary device connects by Wi-Fi to what's the black box called? The remote device. And so, and your remote device, is it spewing data?  Is it the way that you have it set up right now? Is it just like sending some data set, or is there some data going in between?  Or from the remote device to the primary device?

7:06 - Chris
  Currently at present, the ones we've sent you, everything is actually going to the cloud, and then the cloud is communicating back and forth to the devices.  Eventually, which we're working on right now, is the communication of both of them. So I wouldn't say we're connecting, the app's connecting to Bluetooth, we're just using the Bluetooth for the initial pairing.  I think we'll probably end up using Wi-Fi, will probably be the best method for the app at this point.  But again, if we were to do just Bluetooth, right, then you have to have a preset Bluetooth, you know, I mean, correction, if we're just using Wi-Fi, you'd have a preset Wi-Fi signal, you'd have to change your phone to that signal, and then tell it, hey, pair with my device, here it is.  So the reason why we're leaning towards Bluetooth is just... Making it easier for the user. But for the most part, it's just being able to get the device paired onto the Wi-Fi.  And yes, you're right. The devices themselves are basically taking data and sending it up to the cloud. Now, the primary one, which is always powered, is always on.  So Wi-Fi is communicating always. However, it does sampling tests every two minutes. And then every 10 minutes, it sends its information to the cloud.  And then at the same time, it gets updates from the cloud back to it. The remote's a little different because it's battery.  So we're trying to make sure it lasts the longest. So right now, for the most part, the system, although it's set up to test every 10 minutes, it does like six samples.  Real quick. mean, but it's less than a second. mean, it takes us about 120 milliseconds to wake up, make sure the sensors are all awake, receiving information that gets stored in the device and kept.  And then after, you know, an hour, it then takes all that information and sends it to the cloud. And the whole purpose on this is to try to make sure that if right now, if we're using lithium, the last two years, if you're using alkaline batteries, the last two years, easily, probably a year and three months.  But it's more trying to keep these devices lasting the longest. And we started with the remote. It's the same chip on the primary that's in the remote.  And then the one thing we've, you know, on the primary, we also added a chip on the remote. So it will not, let's just say it's pretty accurate as far as time.  You will not get time shift. You might get, if you weren't syncing with Wi-Fi and it was still running, you might get maybe a one or two second shift in about four months.  So by that, when the primary, let's say if you lose power in your house and it comes back on since there is no real storage, it has enough capacitance on it to store the current data it has.  When it comes on, if it can't get onto the Wi-Fi, the remote will then provide the time for it, since we know the remote will always have an accurate clock.  And then when it's able to connect to the Wi-Fi, bam, it'll update itself. So for the most part, we've just been, our devices are nothing more than, let's say, a data processing system passing it to the cloud.  And so from the app's perspective, all we're really needing the app to do is, aside from setting up a new user, pairing the devices, it's just going to be reporting what's in the cloud.  able and powerhouse. Okay, perfect.

11:03 - Eric Silverthorn
  And are we, do you want us to Bluetooth pair to each of these devices, both the primary and remote device?  Yes, you're going to need to pair both of them.

11:15 - Chris
  And again, I put them both in pairing mode right now, so they're both in pairing mode. I would tell you, while they're doing all the testing, test it with the primary.  It'll be the easiest one. Yeah. Because it'll always be on, plus it's powered, you know. So once they get that one down, then they can jump over to the battery one.  There are some little tricks on the battery one, which aren't too bad. The main one is, on the primary, and if you press the reset button for just a second, it'll wake up our sensors.  This is more like proof that our sensors are working. There's no issues. If you continue to hold it, it'll go all the way up to about five to six seconds.  And you'll see a blue light appear, which means... So now you're in mode. So if you were to release it, you'd be now clear to pair.  Even if you had a pre-existing Wi-Fi, it'll just wipe it out and put you in pairing mode. If you were instead just to hold it and get it past the blue until you only get to a red light, you're doing a hard reset on the device.  So in case you have some issue with it, those are just the processes we've done. Now on the remote, it's a little different because we don't have all the lights, but it's still the same process.  If you press with a push pin or paper clip in that one little hole and select it, if you push it just a little bit, it would wake up the sensors for 10 seconds.  If you push and hold it for about five to six, you'll see the blue light going on, it'll be in pairing mode.  If you did the same thing again, push and hold it on there for 10 seconds, it'll do a hard reset of the system.  The remote's not as bad because every single time it goes to sleep, it really does a hard reset. So it's not as critical.  Okay, great. Yeah, yeah, it's very good.

13:05 - Eric Silverthorn
  Those were the only questions that I had right now. And, Jonah, are you recording this? I am.

13:13 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Yeah, perfect. Okay, great.

13:15 - Eric Silverthorn
  I know the speaker is there. What's that?

13:18 - Chris
  Well, you know, what I was going to say, you bring up a good point, you know, because right now we were originally sticking with just Bluetooth devices.

13:27 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Yes, there is a lot of strength on Bluetooth.

13:30 - Chris
  We're open if you guys recommend something, but for the most part, most of our devices are based on, we're going to really be just using the Wi-Fi on it at present.

13:42 - Eric Silverthorn
  Yeah, I think that's a good, I think that Wi-Fi is a better path. I mean, we've all experienced the, there's sometimes craziness in communicating in Bluetooth.  Like, how many times have you gotten in your car? You know, how many times have gotten Your car and the Bluetooth drops out or you're even going down the road and, you know, whatever it is that's taking place in the spectrum at that moment, the Bluetooth drops out and you have to, you know, either have to intervene or whatever.  I think that's far less likely with Wi-Fi. And so for the initial setup, I think using Bluetooth for that is, I mean, I think that's the appropriate place to do it.  You know, it's the appropriate process. And then using Wi-Fi for the transmission. I think that's, I think it's better.

14:42 - Chris
  So the one other thing I would say is within our system itself, we're also adding another, there'll be another app after this, and it'll be for service groups who will be supporting it.  So pretty much the service group, you know, we envision. Hey, when they assign a service group to support their, they'll be able to share all this information with them.  So you'll have to go on, approve service group, they'll select it, and based on their location, they'll share it based on location.  So after this, the next app should be fairly simple, almost a re-same thing. We just need to add our service group, and service group may have a little more information they can pull up.  But that'll be our next stage after this one, just FYI, so you're aware of it. That said, I guess, what do you need from us to help us assist?  You know, what do you see as the, I'm assuming you have your team right now working on pairing, because that was our first challenge.  know, hey, get the system set up on Wi-Fi, and let's just prove that the. Single platform will work. And how much time do you see this taking?  And, you know, I'm just all about timelines. So you have to excuse me. My old military are still strong.

16:14 - Eric Silverthorn
  So the devices are supposed to arrive on Wednesday, which means we can start work on Thursday or Friday. I suspect that we'll need overall a week and a half, you know, maybe a week and a half.  It could go a little bit faster. And so let me just pull up a calendar.

16:43 - Chris
  The one thing I would say is I would not push them. I would push them to make sure it's robust and stable.
  ACTION ITEM: Talk to lead dev, create schedule for AER team re. app development (target Jul 11)
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/331287079?timestamp=1012.9999  There are as many things at it, you know. I'm not one of those, oh, we got it working. Well, if you get it working one time and you're not repeatable, to me that's not working.  It's... I understand.

17:03 - Eric Silverthorn
  You know, it would probably be best for me to talk to the lead developer, and then we can get a schedule over to you.  I would say, as a goal, I would like to have something by the 11th of July.

17:26 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Okay.

17:30 - Eric Silverthorn
  You know, and I think we would only be plus or minus a couple of days.

17:35 - Chris
  Yeah, I'm just saying, you know, for the most part, that should be more than enough. I mean, let's just make sure it's robust and strong, and I mean, and then we'll jump on to that next phase.  But this one's really the first one is, let's make sure that our proposal of single platform works for both Android and Android.  we've got Okay.

18:00 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Hey, let's go. What do you perceive in testing for us?

18:07 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Does the 11th mean that we're ready to go, or does that mean that we need time to test?

18:14 - Eric Silverthorn
  My goal would be that we're happy with what we see and we get a build to you. And if we can get a build to you before, of course, we'll do that, that you can install on Android and iOS devices.  But I think that would be, I think that would be enough time on our side. We may be tweaking some things after that, but, you know, there could be several builds.  Yeah, easily.

18:49 - Chris
  I'm expecting a minimum of three has always been my experience. Yeah, sure. Little tweaks.

18:58 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  What we'll do is we'll share … On TestFlight, which is through Apple. That's how we'll share builds for iPhone.  And on Android, we'll share via APK. So TestFlight, those updates will just get pushed to your phone. You'll just choose to automatically update.  And via APK, we'll share the link on the Slack channel that we have. Okay.

19:21 - Chris
  That'll be for Android.

19:23 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Yep. James will handle the Android, I'll handle the iPhone.

19:28 - Chris
  Perfect.

19:31 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  And James, I actually just re-sent the Apple invitation to you. So this first invite is to Apps for Connect.  Once that's accepted, then I can invite you to TestFlight. And that's where you'll be able to go through. And sorry if I just said what wasn't true, which is that Chris might be testing iPhone and James is testing Android.  But I just want to make sure you're set up just in case. Yeah, just in case it's... Yeah. Yeah.  Um... Yeah. Okay, fantastic. Chris, anything else, or James, anything else for our team?

20:05 - Chris
  No, it's just more, so then the next thing I would say is once we get this, then we, I guess we can, what's the plan for just phased meetings or just updates?  Because I know time is critical for everyone, you know, but at the same time, you we want to use our time most efficiently.  Exactly. So that's the one thing I guess I would sort of throw out there. How do you guys want to set our, you know, okay, 11 July, do we need to meet between now and then?
  ACTION ITEM: Set up weekly Friday update emails + Slack msgs to AER team
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/331287079?timestamp=1232.9999  What's the weekly plan? I just tend to stick to weekly plans. So what we'll do is we'll send updates each Friday.

20:47 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  And obviously, if there's a breakthrough before then, we'll be sure to let you all know in the Slack channel.  If we reach success before that 11th, I think it's definitely appropriate to hop on a call. As there's deliverables, we'll be sure to let you guys know.  And then if we have success in this round, I think then we get together and we just map out the timeline moving forward and make sure that our goal and phases align with what you guys want.  In our proposal, we map out essentially what we want to work on first, then second, then third, and then fourth.  So we'd probably just pick up from that, knowing now that we have the pairing figured out. And we can just work there.  know that you wanted to be aggressive in terms of payment, just that there's no blockers there. But yeah, I assume that'll probably be the easiest part is locking down that schedule and then just letting our team complete the product with checks by y'all and us.
  ACTION ITEM: Complete Apple TestFlight setup process (retry invite)
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/331287079?timestamp=1297.9999  Jinx, you have anything?

21:48 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  Jinx, not at this point, except I did try to do the Apple thing earlier, Jonah, and it didn't let me.  I just got your new one and it's having me redo all my stuff again. So I'll let you know if I have a problem.  But hopefully it'll work this time. Okay. I will tell you.

22:04 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Yeah, it actually, I'm noticing that it's bouncing a couple times. So I don't know if App Store Connect is having some issues right now.  But if it gives you too much trouble, please let me know. I'm more than happy to try to trouble you.

22:15 - Chris
  I will tell you it was much easier doing Android and setting up the account than it was Apple. I had a pre-existing account that I had to roll into an organization.  That took an entire day.

22:28 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Yeah. So we constantly get annoyed customers when they're having to set up the Apple stuff. And the only thing I can say is it's not us.  We're not. No, no, I know.

22:45 - Chris
  But it was like I was saying, you know, once they said it was actually complete, wasn't. It took them another day.  That's why when I sent you guys the invite first, I was like, I can't get mad in right. What's up with this?  Yeah, right.

22:58 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Oh, yeah.

22:58 - Chris
  You need to wait another 24 hours. And why'd you tell me it was done? No, I definitely understand that.

23:07 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Well, wonderful. Well, I appreciate you guys hopping on here. And, yeah, we'll be sure to keep you guys posted along the way.  The Slack channel will definitely be best for daily and then the weekly updates. And we'll be sure to also send those weekly updates as an email just so that there's a thread.  But that way, all of our communication stays in one nice theme thread. All right.

23:27 - Chris
  And we're here if you guys have any questions. I'm sure, of course, you know, I'm fairly flexible, especially if it's coming from India.  Is there, what are they, a 14-hour difference? And a half, 12 and a half, depending on what they are.

23:43 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  That's a half, you have to add the half in there.

23:46 - Eric Silverthorn
  Yeah.

23:47 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  But the important thing to mention, too, so our developers do bleed over into R&D quite a bit. And so, you know, one, our goal is that you guys aren't impacted by the time difference at all.  But two, you know, if we need to have calls. Follows and things like that, you know, our team is set up to be able to support.  So, so wonderful. All right. Well, thank you.

24:08 - Chris
  And it's a pleasure meeting all. Looking forward to working with you and your team. Of course.

24:15 - James Magnuson (AER-Solutions)
  We'll look forward to the next update.
  ACTION ITEM: Notify Chris/James when devices arrive to dev team in India
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/331287079?timestamp=1459.9999

24:18 - Chris
  And fingers crossed that we don't discover anything, which we usually do, but that's all right. We'll get by. Excellent.  Well, and I'll send you a note.

24:30 - Eric Silverthorn
  Next week, Chris, when the, Chris and James, both, I'll send you guys notes when the developer, when it, when, when it lands in India, when it gets in their hands.

24:39 - Chris
  That'd be awesome. Perfect. Thank you very much. Terrific. Thanks a bunch, guys.

24:45 - Jonah Silverthorn (Semaphore Mobile Dev)
  Talk soon, y'all. Thank you. Take care. Take care.

25:00 - Chris
  Take care. Take care.
